# Moe-s-6-9-Axel-Collar-Bearing
I have finished creating all of my pieces now I can start the sub assembly.
It was kinda easy making those ast three pieces was it was also tricky keeping up with everything and how many extrudes I had to make.
# Axel and Collar
I'm gong to end the link for the Axel And Bearing because they are in the same document.

# Bearing
The bearing is in the same document as my Wheel so i'll send the link, but anyways it also very easy to create this bearing. It was probably the easiest thing to create.
